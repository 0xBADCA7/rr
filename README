Installation guide for rr
=========================


A) Hardware/Software requirements
---------------------------------

The current version of rr requires a Linux kernel version 2.6.39 and larger.
To enable PEBS support for the hardware performance counters (HPC) a kernel
version >= 3.0 is required. Furthermore, rr does not support x86_64. rr was
developed under Ubuntu 11.04.

rr requires two additional libraries:

(1) libpfm-4.1.0: The library can be downloaded from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/perfmon2/files/libpfm4/libpfm-4.1.0.tar.gz/download

(2) libdisasm-dev



B) Building 
-----------

rr is developed with Eclipse CDT plugin. You can import the project directly into
Eclipse. Eclipse then generates a makefile which you can use to build the project.


C) Usage
--------

Before calling either the recorder or the replayer make sure that address space
randomization is disabled. You can do this by e.g., with the following command:

sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0


Typing rr --record /path/to/binary invokes the recorder. The recorder
creates a path in the current directory which containts the trace file(s).
To replay the application, type rr --replay /path/to/trace.
